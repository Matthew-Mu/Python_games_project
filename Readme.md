Python Game Projects


    Hello, and welcome to my little simple python projects, of making games. I believe the easier way of learning more of a language is by doing simple projects, and what's better then gaming projects.

Now i am working my way up to AI and ML projects in python. but for this repo were just focused on simple game projects that you can make in python with just a few lines of code. I have more to add. 

ALso keep a watch out for my AI and ML python projects. i was accepted into the amazon ML learning on the the Udicity platform, and thei teaching us AI and ML, and in a few months the final project will be due, and the top 500 coders, will go on to get a free nano degree in AI and ML. But though out this whole aventurer we have the chance of being interviewed by amazon or one of the other companies. You should check them out. they have this project every few months, i think a winter, and a summer project. and evevn if your not one of the 500 coders. You still get a degree for free. Which is really awesome.

So be on the look out for them projects pretty soon, and it will give you a idea of how the program works, and what they expect.

Well that's all for now.
Happy coding.

P.S the guessing game has a bug in it, can you guess what it is and fix it. good first contribuation, for the studnets out there just starting.
